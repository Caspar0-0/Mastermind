# Mastermind
This program is a MasterMind game between a human and an AI, or both AIs, or both humans. One, as the codeMaker, selects a four color secret code using empty, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. The order is relevant and duplicates are allowed. The codeBreaker has ten attempts to guess the secret code. After each guess, the codeMaker issues a black  peg for each of the breaker's slots which matches both the location and position in the secret code, and a white peg if the color is correct but not the location. If this game is between AIs, it will only print out the number of games for the TRIALS set and then program  will ask whether the user would like a restart. If the answer starts with n or N. The program will print out the average game's turn length.
